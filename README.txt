This project does not predict lottery numbers accurately, but it could be used as a basis for similar - less
random tasks. 

2.5 thousand examples simply isn't enough to truly validate the algorithms viability against 1/>45,000,000 odds.

As of right now, there are evident issues with the algorithm. There is significant bias meaning that the last
number predicted is nearly always the same. 

Therefore I do plan on continuing to update the project, I will be implementing new models and testing new 
parameters in an attempt to understand which could work better for this kind of a problem. I will possibly look
at implementing dummy data, and I will certainly amend the default values that the algorithm uses. Hence,
this project is far from finished, useful or even efficient - I do however hope it's interesting, and perhaps
useful to someone. 

Usage is very simple through the command line UI.

To train the model type '5' in the prompt.
