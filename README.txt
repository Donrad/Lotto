This project is unfinished, but functional. I will be updating the project as my schedule allows - currently it is not a priority and I have other projects I am focusing on.

Notes:

- The 3 scraping functions (getTrainData, getTestData, get21TestData) do not do as their name implies and split the data. This is handled by scikit later in the code. The three functions do however provide the most up-to-date, non-duplicate lottery numbers when 'First time setup' is run from the command line UI.

- There are some minor sections of code that are not currently important to the codes functionality (for example round(float) of some of the numbers), but as it is updated the necessity of these functionaities may return.

- While the program doesn't accurately predict lottery numbers, the project is a good template for similar machine learning projects.

- The Random Forest classifier is not a good choice for this challenge, a new model will be introduced soon. 

- To use the program, install the requirements in the requirements.txt file - and run the program in the console. Follow the instructions from there.

- To train the model type '5' in the prompt.
